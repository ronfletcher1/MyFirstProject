# This is my first python project
# This project will consist of questions related to python where the
# user can selct from multiple choice and true or false questions
# users will be rewarded for answering each question correctly.  
# Requirements:
    # student name
    # list of questions easy, medium, hard, extreme
    # you pay to get a question e, m, h, e
    # coin rewards
    # gifts to purchase with reward coins
    # leader board rankings

# EASY Q's
# 1. 
# MEDIUM Q's

# HARD Q's

# EXTREME Q's

# Why must ‘self’ be used explicitly in method definitions and calls?

#Can’t you emulate threads in the interpreter instead of relying 
# on an OS-specific thread implementation?
    # Answer 1: Unfortunately, the interpreter pushes at least one C stack 
    # frame for each Python stack frame. Also, extensions can call back into 
    # Python at almost random moments. Therefore, a complete threads 
    # implementation requires thread support for C.

    # Answer 2: Fortunately, there is Stackless Python, which has a completely 
    # redesigned interpreter loop that avoids the C stack.
